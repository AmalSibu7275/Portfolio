                Project Overview<br>
                "Guess the Number – Horror Edition" is a web-based interactive game built as a creative twist on the classic number guessing game. Designed with a hand-drawn, horror-themed aesthetic, the project was developed to enhance both front-end development skills and user engagement through visual storytelling and suspense-driven gameplay.
                <br><br>
                Key Features<br>
                Interactive Gameplay: The user attempts to guess a randomly generated number within a given range. Each wrong guess triggers horror-themed feedback (e.g., eerie sounds, flickering screen effects, or creepy animations).
                <br>
                Hand-Drawn Visual Style: The UI embraces a sketchy, illustrated horror art style to create a unique and immersive atmosphere. Assets and UI elements were custom-styled to reflect a haunted or eerie theme.
                <br>
                Responsive Design: Built to run smoothly on desktop and mobile devices, adapting to various screen sizes while maintaining atmosphere and gameplay clarity.
                <br>
                JavaScript Logic: Core gameplay—including random number generation, input validation, and result evaluation—is implemented in clean, modular JavaScript.
                <br>
                User Feedback: Players receive dynamic responses based on their guesses, including jump scares or narrative messages to maintain tension.
                <br>
                Version Control: Tracked using Git for code collaboration and history management.
                <br><br>
                Learning Outcomes<br>
                Strengthened understanding of JavaScript logic, DOM manipulation, and event handling.
                <br>
                Applied responsive design principles and CSS animation techniques.
                <br>
                Gained experience in integrating aesthetic themes into functional code.
                <br>
                Collaborated on version control using Git with another developer (Amal S.).
                <br><br>
                Challenges Overcome<br>
                Balancing gameplay logic with thematic visual elements without overwhelming the user.
                <br>
                Ensuring performance optimization across devices despite animated and stylistic assets.
